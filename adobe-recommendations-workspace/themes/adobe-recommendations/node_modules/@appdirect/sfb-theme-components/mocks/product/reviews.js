It also can be quite a bit harder to create and edit documents. I used this for a REST interface on my SQL DB, it creates all the services for you, so I was using stored procedures. You can do user management and role based access, there is a way to do record level access, looking into that. No problems so far its great. Microsoft 365 has helped my department stay better connected with one another, and given us the ability to easily share documents and reports amongst one another. Microsoft 365 helps to keep all of our Microsoft applications accessible in one place, which in turn helps save time and energy. It does a great job of keeping records of who last edited a document including time stamps. I just recently learned about this platform, but it wasn\'t until I downloaded the free trial and looked into it that I started to understand everything this platform does.'

It\'s one of those rare times where it really isn\'t all marketing hype, the darned thing really is that good. I\'d honestly give their support group more than five stars if that were possible. We were one of the early adopters of the DreamFactory Services Platform after a bunch of discussions with our consultants. After considering a bunch of other options, we finally agreed on DSP primarily because of security. We do not need to trust an additional cloud provider - I was able to install on Amazon and connect my Azure account easily. We have not been disappointed. They have listened to our feedback and given us most of what we have asked for. Support is top notch and speedy.\n\nThe roadmap looks promising. My team cannot wait for the next version to come out to integrate and release our app update. \n\nA big thank you to the DreamFactory team and good luck on the next version.',

Nice that we can deploy DreamFactory on OpenShift when we\'re ready to go live with our first few of apps. '
