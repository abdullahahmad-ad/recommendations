# Introduction
<br />

In the `Customization` section, we will explain how a Marketplace Manager can customize a component through the Storefront Builder visual editor with the [schema](?path=/docs/docs-customization-schema--docs#schema) object and the [schema form component types](?path=/docs/docs-customization-schema-component-types--docs#schema-component-types).

Also, with the [settings.json](http://localhost:8088/?path=/story/docs-customization-settings-file--page#settingsjson-file) file in your Plaza theme, you can immediately set default components for your storefront pages.

Next, we explain how a Marketplace Manager can use the [Layout Management](?path=/docs/docs-customization-layout-management--docs#layout-management) feature in the Plaza theme to dynamically manage component layout in a page container section.

Finally, we provide an overview of the [Custom Components](?path=/docs/docs-customization-custom-components--docs) that the theme developer can build to extend existing components from the `sfb-theme-components` library.
